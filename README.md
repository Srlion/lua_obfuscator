# lua_obfuscator
This is more like a bytecode converter: lua code -> luajit bytecode -> lua code

There are lots of stuff that is taken from many sources that I can't remember because this was just a private thing I'm working on.

How to use:
luajit main.lua INPUTFILE OUTPUTFILE (Optional)USE_UTF8

You can tell me if you find a part of code that is used from someone so I can give them credits.
